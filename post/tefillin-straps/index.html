    <p>This morning as I finished my morning prayers, I took a minute just to look at my tefillin and think about a few lessons to draw them from.</p>

<p>Tefillin straps are bound on your non-dominant arm going away from your body; this causes a very important thing to happen - the more you turn your arm away, the tighter the straps become.</p>

<p>So what&rsquo;s the big deal?</p>

<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve learned from this, is that going away from your problem (being bound) it gets harder, whereas turning towards your problem (the binding) things get easier. Life becomes easier when you stop fighting it and start living it.</p>

<p>Restrictions are only challenges when you make them challenges.</p>

<p>When you fight your personal restrictions, when you tell yourself that life is over because you can&rsquo;t have that BLT or because you can&rsquo;t go to that party next Friday night, you are making your own life hard. It isn&rsquo;t the restrictions, the bindings, making your life difficult, it is your own inability to accept how things are and work within those restrictions.</p>

<p>This also applies to dieting and health.</p>

<p>The slice of pizza in your mind, or the cookies on the counter, only look delicious and tasty because you&rsquo;ve decided to make them delicious and tasty. You&rsquo;ve decided to push against your own restrictions and make things difficult for yourself, whereas if you just accept that you won&rsquo;t be eating either of these things, then your diet is just that much easier.</p>

<p>The lesson I learned from the tefillin straps isn&rsquo;t just accept and go with the flow, but also to challenge and never relent. When someone challenges you and tries to break you, you have to keep fighting, keep resisting the turning and stay bound to what you&rsquo;ve set out to do.</p>

<p>The binding that stands in the way only increases the pressure the more you turn, it can never stop your turning completely. This truth applies to every facet of life. Absolutely <strong>no one</strong> and absolutely <strong>nothing</strong> can stop you from doing anything you are determined to do except you.</p>

<p>And that is exactly the purpose and lesson of the tefillin straps. They have power over you because you are the one that bound them to your arm; you are the one that gave them that power.</p>

<p>Unbind them, take away that power, and they are not much more than mere leather.</p>
