    <p>About a month ago, my wife and I moved to a new apartment (technically, it&rsquo;s a condominium that we&rsquo;re renting). It&rsquo;s a gated community complete with RFID access cards and one of those boxes where visitors dial a code to ask us to let them through the gate. Thankfully, the gate isn&rsquo;t tied to a landline and can be associated with a cell phone - it&rsquo;s very modern.</p>

<p>There are a couple shortcomings with the system: you only can connect one number and you can&rsquo;t (or rather, the management office won&rsquo;t) setup a generic access code to give to friends and family. The former is a minor, manageable annoyance; it has been manageable thus far but it is far from ideal. The latter issue is more (but not much more) of a challenge.</p>

<p>My wife and I are observant jews, and as such, keep shabbat and don&rsquo;t answer the phone. We often have guests (some do and some don&rsquo;t keep shabbat) for the shabbat meals and this gate situation was really hampering our style.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>.</p>

<p>Twilio provides an API to programmatically handle phone calls and text messages; after a quick signup and a few lines of <a href="http://www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml">TwiML</a>, I had a phone number that picks up a call and &ldquo;dials&rdquo; the code to open the gate.  If I so desired, with a few lines of ruby code, I can have an access control system that I manage.</p>

<p>I can understand the position of the HOA office. I wouldn&rsquo;t want to open the pandora&rsquo;s box of supporting an access code management system beyond what is currently in place and I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t want to deal with supporting a self-service system either. That being said, I wish they would have given us a general access code (even if they told us not to share it), obviating my need to bypass the security system entirely. My wife requested such a code and, only after a decent amount of convincing, they would only give us a 24 hour code as a rare exception.</p>

<p>The ease that I can bypass the &ldquo;security&rdquo; of our gated community just goes to show how little security it provided in the first place.  Despite giving the appearance and (false) sense of security, I suppose that the true purpose of the gate traffic control, not access control and that true security, as always, is up to everyone using the system.</p>
